Remember those glowing plastic bugs taht sat in the corner of the room
slowly changing from one colour to the next?  Here's an emulation of
that for WebOS smartphones.  It has a variety of modes to suit your
every mood!

Current modes are:

<ul>
<li>Multicoloured (change from red -> yellow -> green -> cyan -> blue -> magenta -> red)
<li>Shine from black to red and back
<li>Shine from black to green and back
<li>Shine from black to blue and back
</ul>
